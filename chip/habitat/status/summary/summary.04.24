Subject: Today's summary report
Status: R

Here is the task summary for Friday, April 24.

I have incorporated Randy's summary of the ARF's for the past few days'
testing.  For the sake of having an unambiguous reference scheme, I have gone
and numbered all the outstanding past items with 'x' numbers (#x1 through
#x55).  Following Randy's convention, the items from the 4/14-4/15 fax memo
are numbered #1 through #30, while ARF items will now be numbered
consecutively from #100 (top item is currently #116).

This will be a little confusing for a while until we get the summary report
format straight between us.  Randy: let's discuss this.

Also, to some of the items (notably #12, #113 and #114) I have added
parenthetical comments in square brackets [like this].  Y'all should take
notice of these, because we need to make some decisions.

Format: Left-hand column is priority/release requirement ('A' = alpha, 'B' =
beta, 'R' = release, '-' = usable as done, '+' = strictly wishlist item).
Next column to the right is status: 'D' = done, 'T' = testing, 'W' = working
on it, ' ' = pending, 'I' = just an idea right now.  Next comes the initials
of the people responsible for the item, then the item tag number, and finally
the item itself.
