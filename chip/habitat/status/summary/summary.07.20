Here is the task summary for Moon-day, July 20.

beta, 'R' = release, '+' = strictly wishlist item).  Next column to the right
is status: 'D' = done, 'T' = testing, 'W' = working on it, ' ' = pending, 'I'
= just an idea right now, 'N' = we decided not to do it at all.  Next comes
the initials of the people responsible for the item, then the item tag number,
