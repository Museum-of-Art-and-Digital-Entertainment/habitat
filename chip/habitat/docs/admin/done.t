I've examined the development contract to figure out what dangling obligations
there may still be.  According to the list of milestones and deliverables,
here is how we stand:

For May 15, we were to deliver "full system beta-test version: C64 disk with
home system object, preliminary user and system documentation".  I think that
there is no question but what we have met this.

For June 15, we were to deliver a debugged system, "full system revised
version with debugged C64 home system disk, modified user documentation",
i.e., an improved version of the software with documentation updated to match.
My interpretation of the intent of this deliverable was to provide an
intermediate version in between the initial beta-test disk and the final disk.
We were also to provide "Rev. 1" object code for Avatar and Turf customization
kits.  The Avatar customization package is installed and working.  Turf
customization has been incorporated into the regular system design, rather
than as a separate software package; however, the software for Turf
customization is installed and working.  Since we have been providing them
software and documentation updates continuously, I think we have met this one
too.

For July 15, we were to deliver "full system delivery: C64 disk with home
system object code, final rev. of host system (Q), final user documentation"
(the parenthetical "Q" says that Quantum was to provide the final host
system).  Implied but not explicitly stated is that the C64 software here is
to be the final (release) rev.  We have not delivered anything that we have
declared to be "the final version".  I think the present version is very close
to final, but I won't bet that beta testing won't turn up a few more minor
bugs.  The intent was that there would be beta-test feedback upon which to
base the final version, but since beta-test has not begun due to the host
being unready, we have no such feedback.  To the extent that we have
up-to-date feedback from Quantum, the present version of the C64 software is
complete.  We can make an argument that we have met this one.  The
successfulness of such an argument will depend upon your persuasive ability.

For August 15, we were to deliver "final system operation documents, reports".
I am currently preparing operation documents, which should be ready in rough
form within a day or two.  Final reports will not be appropriate until there
is something final to report on.

That's the way it is...
