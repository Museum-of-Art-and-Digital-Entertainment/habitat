MUST be done today:
-------------------
 1. fix mem-fault glitch (r+c)
 2. make furniture work (r+a)
 3. verify that new-user customization works (r+j+c)
 4. verify that track/sector update works (r+j+c)
 5. make put into pockets/get from pockets work (r+c)
 6. fix faces appearing on headless avatars (r or a)
 7. test bottle asynchronous FILL (c or r)
 8. test bottle asynchronous POUR (c or r)
 9. test drugs asynchronous TAKE (c or r)
10. test escape device asynchronous BUGOUT (c or r)
11. test fake gun asynchronous RESET (c or r)
12. test grenade synchronous/asynchronous (c or r)
13. write avatar_kill on host (c)
14. test avatar DIE (c or r)
15. test gun synchronous/asynchronous against avatars/objects (c or r)
16. test knife synchronous/asynchronous against avatars/objects (c or r)
17. test stun gun synchronous/asynchronous (c or r)
18. test throw clamp at horizon (c or r)
19. test walk clamp at horizon (c or r)

SHOULD be done today:
---------------------
20. add chore in fake gun asynchronous FAKESHOOT (r or c)
21. figure out why Fastlink is broken and fix it (r)
22. fix sound effect in teleport asynchronous ZAPOUT (r+chris)
23. improved region transition walk sound effect (r+chris)
24. install title music (r+chris)
25. tune event timing in atm withdraw (c)
26. test stereo/tape LOAD/UNLOAD synchronous/asynchronous (c or r)
27. turn on bandwidth reduction (r+j)

SHOULD be done today but are purely host based (so TODAY isn't so imperative):
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28. fix host database glitches: plants need mass, rocks need mass, furniture
	needs open flags, everything needs width, lamps should be on (c)
29. echo talk through host (?) (c)
30. nuke class backpack (c)
31. nuke class credit card (c)
32. remove double echo when talking to yourself (c)
33. turn on collision detection in host (c)

Would be NICE to have today:
----------------------------
34. add asynchronous chore to atm (c or r)
35. handle compass in region entry daemon (c)
36. handle light in region entry/exit daemons (c)
37. handle lights and containers correctly (c)
38. handle security device in entry daemon (c)
39. implement ticket read (c+r)
40. test jukebox (such as it is) (c or r)
