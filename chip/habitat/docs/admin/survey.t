To all Habitat Alpha Testers:

Thank you for your help so far in
debugging Habitat.

Now, we'd appreciate some feedback
on the Habitat environment and
experience.

Please take thirty minutes or so
to fill out the questionnaire
which follows on the next 25
pieces of mail by Tuesday night,
December 15th.

Since this is will take a little
of your time, you may want to
go to a private area to avoid
plus charges.

All mail is sent from a different
username, so it is important that
you respond to each piece of mail
directly, using F7 and the respond
function.

Thanks again for your time and
efforts!

I didn't particularly notice the
