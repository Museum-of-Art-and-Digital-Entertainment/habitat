 or just the response to select from,
 so I'll risk life and limb by inputting
 a comment. )

Comment: I think many of us are finding
Habitat (in its current stage) to be a
bit boring. This might be reinforced by
some of the postings on the Board meant
for that purpose.
:
With current limitations on what to do,
where to go, for the most part one can
travel (seemingly) the entire "world" in
2 hours without really accomplishing
much in a game or adventure sense.
:
Little surprises would be nice...A
found token (location generated at
random from time to time, or a "free"
ride on a PORT might be nice...just a
little more than the expected all the
time.)

I locked up when the first question was
asked and didn't get to read it all or
respond.  I would, however, rate Habitat
Fair for my own (non-game enthusiast)
use and very Good for the "masses".

Easy, most of the time.
But sometimes (GETting small objects,
F7 for region #, mostly) the cursor has
to be positioned carefully, which could
lead to problems.

In general, Very Easy...however, some
of the younger people might find it
hard to use some of the items without
any instructions for them
(eg. shovel or chainsaw)

good, but some things are difficult
particularly if you don't understand
what's supposed to be going on.

re: how much fun?

not much, after the first hour or two.
of course, I expect this has a lot to
do with the fact that there aren't
more than a handful of avatars around.
.
it needs more adventures, and easier
ones, that people can master quickly.

I like the ability to create my own
character - that being the loveable but
ornery old "HabiHermit" who talks when
he feels like it, and hates ESP.
:
Travelling around picking up bits and
scraps and taking them to the Pawn Shop
have been noted by others on the system,
and "RJScott" has gotten a reputation
for doing so.
:
Also, the ability to complain to the
Editor of the RANT, and seeing one's
complaints published is a treat. One can
say pretty much what one wants to and
not risk offending anyone else, since
we're dealing with "created characters"
rather than the real personality.
:
A recent example of this was when I
requested a citizen's arrest of the
sheriff's wife, Becky, for failure to
remove Pre-Election promotions and
requests for votes. All parties accepted
that in good humor.

 I would say the best thing I like about
Habitat is that it helps to make people,
er Avatars, more human! Actually seeing
a representation of the person you are
talking to helps to make that person mor
more real, if you know what I mean. The
other thing I like about Habitat was the
exploration of new areas. I think adding
more areas to explore and find things
would be a great advantage to the game.
Also testing things to see what they do
is fun. The "change machine" and the "Do
Not Press This Button" were FUN!  :)

It's hard to pin down any ONE thing that
I like about Habitat. I love the inter-
active role-playing that is possible
through the concept of Avatars. I like
the adventures (which are necessarily
limited during Alpha Testing). The
graphics are fantastic, although some
more effort on variation in scenes might
be a good idea. Basically, the entire
CONCEPT of Habitat is what gives me the
enjoyment.

You can also move around and DO things.
This led to some interesting situations,
and many of us found that we didn't
really know as much about others as we
thought. It was very enlightening,
learning who would really be helpful,
and who would just as soon steal not
only your teeth, but your whole head.
It's an almost perfect little micro-
cosm - about as close as you can get
online.

It is a nice world.  The rally was fun
and chalenging and when there were
many people up there, that made it
fun also.
And of course, we made our own fun
too with our own rallies of a sort.

I like the exploring the most...walking
around, discovering new regions, finding
goodies, seeing new pictures, etc.
.
I also like the ability to "do" things
with other people...talking, exploring,
showing off, etc.
.
The fact that this world can hold a new
surprise at any time is appealing.  :)
It seems incredibly versatile.

Mainly...I like the fact that it seems
like you are right there with the other
"players"...P.C. is okay, but after a
few hours in Hab, you actually start
to think that the little guy on the
screen is you, and the other little
folk are really the other people.

Habitat offers a rather true-to-life
environment. I think I enjoy this
aspect, as much as anything. We have
incomes, but there are also prices to
contend with..budgets have to be
planned. Stores/offices can be rented,
jobs can be had, and tokens can be
earned, if you're ambitious enough. A
certain element of crime exists, and one
has to be careful at times. In short,
it's a good reflection of real life,
and Habitat is generally made of what
we bring in with us. WE control the
experience of the environment, rather
than the other way around. I think this
is a very important feature, and has
great potential.

I like the fact that each Avatar can be
made to look different.
I like the fact that I can walk around
and not likely see another identical
twin of myself.
I Like the fact that I have the option
of keeping the way I look exactaly the
same so that other Avatars can recognise
me right away, or that I can change
different aspects of my apearence
whenever I feel like it.
(Why can't we paint shoes??)
.
One other thing I like 'MOST'...
For some reason, I like the feeling that
someone across the country can do
something, and because he did something,
MY disk drive starts working.
I dont know If I am explaining this
feeling properly though. It just adds
to my feeling of 'connectivity'

  The initial experiences in HABITAT
were great.  NEW places to explore,
things to 'DO'.  Venturing into the
unknown holds one's attention.
Reading new issues of the RANT,
exploring the then newly created
Commerce Ave. (or St. or Dr. ... it's
been awhile)... Becky and Gary's
treasure hunts, other treasure hunts;
in other words, I enjoy doing
things, whether there because of the
system or because of other members.

The ability to interface with other

even if it is fantasy it's easier than
PC type interaction.

On the other hand, Habitat allows a 
person to have fun even when he wants

like the way that you can go from region
to region using the "ports"
The friendships that you are able to
make are very enjoyable :)
You can be alone or if you wish you can
do things with other Avatars :)

    Person to person contact was the
best thing about Habitat.  It was the
most fun having a group of Avatars on
the screen, doing silly things with
their characters.  Alas, the last time
they was a group of any size in Pop Town
was for the Sheriff's election.  But
once Habitat goes public, things will be
more fun to do... and the enjoyment
value will increase ten-fold.

the best thing about Habitat is the idea
that you're connected in real time to
hundreds, possibly thousands of other
people... and anything can happen at
any time.
thus far, I haven't seen this promise
fulfilled... but the principal reason
is that there simply aren't hundreds of
people using it.
.
discovering new items and finding out
how they work is fun... but the most
consistently interesting thing is
affecting other people, through the
mechanism of Habitat.  I keep wishing
I could see their reactions, though...

I most enjoyed getting together with
a group of friends, exploring a new
world, one that held an element of
risk.  This made it "feel" more like
a role playing game.  The open
endedness... That you might find a new
place, a new item, a new way to get
somewhere at any time.
The biggest draw for me to continue
is the publicity that said that it would
be an ever-growing world, with new
places, and entire new Realms.  I would
hope that Habitat would NEVER stop
growing, and that there would always be
an element of risk present.

I see a tremendous potential for
interaction. As its name indicates, it
isn't something that "does", it is
something that is. If Habitat is a game,
it is a game in the sense that it gives
a group of people an excuse to meet and
mingle. Most forks don't play scrabble
for the joy of the game, they play to
enjoy the interaction, the contest of
wills. Hab will be interesting because
of the interaction or will become dull
because of the lack of interaction.

Definitely unsolicited ESP, and its
inevitable "DID YOU GET MY ESP?" if the
message isn't responded to.
:
When on the move in the "Ghost" state,
it necessitates the F1 and wait to
"emerge", reply to ESP, and F1 and the
brief wait to "reGhost", only to get
MORE ESP and having to do the same thing
over again.
:
Even though the "AvaHermit" has made it
clear that he "Doesn't Do ESP" there are
those who feel they're the exceptions
and are offended if they get no reply.
They much prefer the "::grumble::" reply
to none at all, but consider, in the
event of a possible scavenger hunt, the
need to UNGHOST to reply to these
unsolicited ESPs. They're really rather
annoying.

 Well... sometimes traveling from area
to area does seem a little tedious and
time consuming but the Teleporters help
with that considerably. The only other
thing is that things have slowed down.
Right now we're limited as to where we
can go and what we can do. This of
course is in direct relation to the
amount of time spent in Habitat. The
first few weeks were a lot of fun! Then
when there weren't any new areas to
explore or new things to do then it
started to become more "common place".
This I'm sure will change when all the
initial bugs are worked out and time can
be spent on building the system instead
of fixing it.

 too much disk accessing, slowing things
down, also the fact that there is
nothing preset, if you cannot afford to
be there all the time, you are lost.. or
you miss out on all the things to do...
  It needs, for infrequent users some
preset parts, little subadventures for
those who cannot get there every day or
so, um, kind of like icebreakers for
those not experienced in D&D type play.
 Some kind of preset goals to get them
started, that ANY new user can get into
at any time, to get the feel, and feel
like they are really part of it, before
they begin to venture out on the one
time type adventuring.

a tree because the avatar's ear touches
it, etc.

Some of the sound effects are a bit
shrill and harsh, when they could be
subtle.
.
Also the lack of things to do.  (This,
of course, should change when/if more

We seem to be having some difficulty
in getting anything going, in there.
This is probably more the fault of the
players, than anything else. Adventures
CAN be had, but no concerted effort has
been made to produce them. Hence,
boredom sets in. I don't think we've
pulled together enough, to see what WE
can do to make things more interesting.
However, I think more could be added to
the environment, to give the players
more incentive to be creative. I think
we've been waiting for the developers
to give us more, rather than trying to
use what we have. These are vague
complaints, but are really the only
ones I have.

The Slowness and the emptyness.....
If you are with a few other avatars
in one reigon, the whole thing seems to
Slow down.
And if you travel alone, it gets
lonely and somewhat boring.
.
ALSO:
I dislike the fact that there doesnt
seem to be anything new to discover.
I realy enjoyed Habitat at first,
But now I hesitate to go, because there
is very little new to do or find.
It is becoming boring.

  The slowness of some functions and
activities.  Merely loading HABITAT
takes quite a while.  Some screen
changes take a good bit of time,
especially those involving disk access.
Getting things out of containers, etc.
I realize that due to the complexity
of the program these are necessary.
  As to actual 'play', without
things to do and to 'DO' it can get
pretty old pretty quickly.  After you've
been around and done what interests you
there isn't much, at this time, to hold
your attention... maybe more folks there
will help.

    Dislike most... two things...
  1. the lack of Avatars - I could walk

and never bump into anyone.
  2. the lack of random events - You
walk around all night and everything
remains the same...static.  There should
be Q-link controlled Avatars walking
around..... things should randomly
appear around you.... And these random
events should make something happen to
your Avatar - Good or Bad.

I dislike the most about Habitat, the
"deadness" of the world.  There does not
seem to be anything to do...treasure
hunts sound fun, but not when everyone
else can manipulate the data when you
are unable to be there.   The difficulty
in this area is that I REALLY believe
that if you get some 100-200 people
playing in there at once, the DEADNESS
will disappear.
.
I also dislike the fact that I've never
been able to get the Oracle to talk
nor figure out what others believe to
be simple things.

let me offer two answers to this one:
.
for myself, what I dislike the most is
learning all there is to know about the
places and objects in Habitat, and not
seeing anything new for a long time.
.
for those who don't have the privileges
I have had, I suspect the thing they
would like the least is not being able
to truly customize their avatar, or
to have any noticeable effect on the
world.  most people consider themselves
to be creative, and they would like to
draw something that they can show the
world, that is uniquely theirs, and not
just bought from some vending machine.
even if it's only a hat.

 The risk of losing everything you

 Reasonable risks lend an element of
 adventure that I enjoy... If I take my
 Avatar someplace hazardous, I'm taking
 the risk.  If I'm getting something
 out of my box right in front of
 The Oracle, I don't expect any risk
 except a snatch and grab thief.
 (We'll have LOTS of those when the
 kids get in.)  Losing all I own because
 I got bumped would irk me, and I love
 Q-Link... I suspect it would set
 even worse with someone who had paid
 a LARGE amount of time and money in

What I dislike is the slowness of
movement, especially when going to
another screen.  Also, the controls to
GO, PUT, GET, etc. can sometimes be
awkward.  If I tell my Avatar to GO
to the next screen, a lot of the time
he will go to the edge of the screen
and sit down.  I have to keep reposition
ing the cursor over and over.  I find
the same problem with GET and PUT
sometimes.

My biggest dislike is the possessiveness
and materialistic feelings that it
generates. Most notably, having other

then feeling cheated when it happens.
  After becomming accustomed to the

Hmmmmm.... well... one thing I would

mailboxes in front of our homes work in
this manner. Have it so others can put
objects in the mailboxes but ONLY the
owner of the mailbox can GET from it.
 I'd also like to see more areas to
explore such as mountainous areas,
orchards (apple orchards especially ;) )
added. I'd also like to see more magical
things happening... unexpected things
that happen to Avatars in their travels.
 Also... I think adventures could be
added... such as fighting monsters and
such. Where shields and weapons could
help to defeat such monsters. I would
also say to put up warnings that monster
s may be present for those who don't w
want to die so they can turn back. Or...
even a mystical land where monsters
dwell... so Avatars could go there to
confront such beasts.  :)
 There should be other ways to avoid or
kill such monsters than by weapons only.
Finding boulders on top of thier cave or
something like that to kill the beasts.
Or say leading the beast to a cliff side
and waiting until the last minute to
leave that area, causing the beast to
fall off... if you leave too soon he
follows you. Things like that.

I'd definitely add more regions, at
this point. After a while, the present
regions become uninteresting, after
numerous trips to them. I'd add more
vendos, with interesting devices/items
for sale, that actually worked. I'd add
an adventure region, where you could
enter at your own risk. The reward
would be treasure, if you could outwit
various traps and pitfalls, installed
as obstacles. Finally, and this is
a small item..I believe we should be
able to lock doors from the INSIDE, in
our turfs, or places of business. As it
stands, if they are occupied, anyone
can walk in; whether you want company

  While exploring the outer areas, the
'travelling music' can get, well,
downright irritating.  Turning it off
can be just as bad, if not worse.
The ability to select from several
pieces of screen change tunes, or
maybe a different score for travelling
in each region... downtown, the suburbs,
the beach, etc.

Changes?  faster disk access
Deletes?  some of the magic items

I guess I'm generally for more regions

DANGER! That is the one thing that seems
to be totally missing from Habitat. The
only way to get hurt is through fellow
Avatars which, of course, causes hard
feelings among the people running the
Avatars. There should be natural dangers
both living and non-living, random and
set, out in the wilderness.

MANY!
1. More movement of items such as water.
2. More selection of wardrobe color.
3. An occasional street that one would
   seem to be "walking down" affording
   a view of BOTH sides of the street
   at the same time.
4. Options for selecting one's own
   "turf" and furnishings to suit one's
   personal tastes.
5. Elimination of the momentary "bounce
   back" of the cursor after selection.
6. Ability to have more than one item
   in one's hand.  Example: You're
   walking down a street and spot a
   TOKEN lying on the street.  Now it
   requires a PUT if you're carrying
   something, then a GET.  Another who
   isn't carrying something would have
   the edge over the other.  If I had
   three bags of groceries in my arms in
   real life, you can bet I'd STILL
   reach down for that $10. bill on the
   street AND get it!
7. A "LIE" position.  Just for a change
   of what can be done, and to indicate
   boredom or disinterest with another's
   antics.
8. Window dressings in the "turfs".
9. The ability to manipulate one's
   "turf" property..that is, to plant
   flowers, dig, etc, within the
   confines of one's property.
10. Selective colors for shoes. Pink
   is fine for women, but not for men.
11. An expanded vocabulary for The
   Oracle. Ex: If I were to ask "him"
   about the "weather" - the string
   "weather" would be part of his
   response.

12. More things to DO! Currently, while
 Habitat is innovative, unless there are
 more "system supplied" things to do, I
 think the new member will tire of it
 quickly.
13. "Eraseable" SYSTEM MESSAGES. Unlike
 a conversation, which SHOULD follow you
 from screen to screen (i.e., ESP) a
 SYSTEM MESSAGE will cause that ESP to
 scroll off the screen.  If a SYSMSG
 could "overlap" the ESP, and be F5'd
 OFF, the ESP would remain.
14. Inclusion of more realistic
 landscapes...rattlers in the desert
 with an occasional prairie dog, or
 birds in the sky (yes, moving) and
 butterflies in the woods...or an
 occasional "woodsy inhabitant" to be
 encountered would add greatly to the
 eye appeal of the product.
15. Racial Avatars: I'm sure that those
 of the black or oriental heritage
 would avail themselves of their
 particular race if permitted to do
 so, and it would add interest to the
 game if it duplicated "real life" in
 that area.
16. The acceptance of input time seems
 to be rather slow.  I don't know if it
 can be speeded up, but those of us who
 type quickly are encountered with a
 series of "boings" when inputting too
 rapidly.

Please read the input in the manner I
intend...constructive.  And thanks for
the opportunity for me to input.

Most of this was covered in my previous

believe more open end teleport
addresses would be a plus. For example,
we can currently type 'home', and arrive
at our turf. Also, I'd like to be able
to do more while ghosted. Use of the
function keys F3, F7, and ESP, come to
mind. It can be a minor nuisance to
have to come out of ghost form to
answer ESP, or use the F7 (help) key.

How about animated animals or monsters
roaming around?
Treasure hunts or region journeys that
when you get there you get habitokens
or free time and clues to the next
region or treasure.
Mmore facial features would be nice
and allow for longer chats in one 
region.
How about an offline tool to create
avatar heads and regions.
Being able to use the extra memory
on the C128 for those users.
or maybe the ram expanders.
It would add value and make disk
access less.
How about some games where have to
kill or battle with monsters or
plan stratigically to get to 
special regions.
If you do get killed you only go
back to your home turf but don't
lose your pocessions.

Habitat life has it too soft. One of the
great motivators of man is the sating of
needs. Avatars and their turfs are too
maintenance free. I'd like to see the
occasional burnt out light that would
require me to head downtown for a
replacement, or temporary color changers
that wear off and need to be replenished
or *something* that would make Ava-life
a bit more realistic. I'd also make the
major body mods (heads, permanent body
paints, etc) very expensive. Hab looses
some of its appeal when you find out
that despite all the visual aspects, you
still can't recognize your friends.

Once Habitat goes "live", or maybe even
just into Beta Testing, there should be
a staff of HabiHelpers(?) online in
Habitat to give assistance to those who
are totally lost. They could be set at
strategic places, such as the Oracles,
midway between towns, in a random place
the woods or desert, etc. Otherwise,
PC's QGuides will be utterly swamped
with questions on it, which, depending
on how much they have tested/entered,
they may not even know. (Which will lead
to frustrated members and QGuides)

I think such places/things as the
bureaucrats-in-a-box and stock market
are unnecessarily stupid.  such things
should be personal transactions...
at minimum, mailed to someone who is
designated to be in charge of it,
Oracle fashion.
there also seem to be too many empty
places with chairs (and sometimes
without).  avatars can get together and
talk anywhere.  a room with chairs is
not only useless, it is an insult to the
intelligence of the average user.
.
that is, unless you WANT to attract
that sort of user... :)

 Refine the weapons free zones so that
 areas within a town are weapons free,
 other areas permit only primitive
 weapons, and yet others permit all
 weapons.  This would prevent guns
 from being introduced into a medival

The Oracle should not be handled as a
wish granter. Requests to the oracle
should rarely be answered. When they are
answered, the answer should require some
action by the Avatar to make it happen.
Examples:
1) Solve a riddle to find the location
   where what they asked for has been
   placed.
2) Direct them to the guild, provide the
   guild with the item which will become
   the prize in a quest.
3) Give them the item, but at a price.

  Being a programmer, I can understand
  the disk load time. I think it is
  VERY well done.
.
  From a general member standpoint,
  however, they will probably complain
  of the load times.
.
  I feel this could be effectively
  explained in the manual in a positive
  way which could change their feelings
  about it.

playing Habitat.
One stupid thing I've done several
times (and given the propensity of
some members......) When first loading,
you have to flip the Habitat disk. When
leaving, you are instructed to insert
the Q-Link disk. Several times I've
absent-mindedly (being the oldest tester
I should be able to get away with that)
flipped the Habitat disk again instead
and found myself in Habilimbo.

Randy's Region Rally: Fun, hard, worth
all the running around to play. (I still
don't understand the final clue, though)
Sheriff Election: I think the LFL team
did an fantastic job for the technical
end of it. The advertisement and billing
for it also was great. The TURNOUT,
however, made the whole thing almost a
waste. (This is NOT because I lost; As
anyone who has talked to me will say, I
really didn't want to win, anyway :D)

The last clue in the Rally was too

maybe not - the one in the Desert.)
Otherwise, I liked it. As for the
election, I thought of a LOT of
embellishments for that - maybe because
I was suffering through a real one at
the time.

I think they were good ideas and well

partly due to the fact tat it is NOT
PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE. Once these events or
any others can be Advertised in the

Randy's Region Rally was much too dif-

would have taken so long to come up
with the correct answer (it was a
couple of weeks), I wouldn't have been
so frustrated with it.
.
The clues were spread out too far, and
too obscure.  Otherwise, that type of
"scavenger hunt" is ideal for the
Habitat environment.

I had major problrems with the Election,
in that the dates that were posted
were not right, and when I went to vote
on the last day that was supposedly
allowable,
there was no more Election site.
Also, although the speeches and
questions with the canditates
were a good idea, and necessary, the
5 Guest limit made some things
difficult

I never did solve the region rally.
I was certain I had the right answer,
but I didn't win.  I felt very
frustrated.  I spent at least ten
hours on it (several hours offline).
it took far too much walking around,
and the puzzle was too difficult.
if I had been paying 8c a minute,
I'm sure I would have given up long
before I even completed the rally.
.
the wedding was a lot of fun, mostly
because the concept was so bizarre.
I think we need more of this.
.

 I really enjoyed the Sherrif Election,
 it didn't take a lot of time to keep
 up with what was going on, and I
 still had time to do other things
 in Habitat.
:
 The Region Rally was frustrating,
 I didn't have a great deal of time
 right then, and was always behind.
 Further, I couldn't be there for the
 opening event, and thus had to rely
 on second hand explanations and guess-
 work.  Anything like this in the
 future should have a rule and/or
 instruction book available cheap,
 that covers the same stuff covered
 at the opening event.

The Rally was a bit too convoluted for
me, but others who were involved seemed
to enjoy it.
The Sheriff's election was well handled,
I liked the town meeting that preceeded
it BUT the dates that were given out
were incorrect and the election was not
followed up at all. Weeks later, Gary
still had no keys to his "office" and no
idea what was expected of him.

once a week, probably.  there should be
something going on every night...
if nothing more than an entertainer on
stage, down at the Good Times Theater.
creating a strong police force would
motivate a lot of games.
.
in general, there should be more things
that require personal involvement...
like a shop keeper actually tending
shop, or a politician making campaign
speeches.  real time and personal is
the ticket - that's Habitat's strongest
feature.  exploit it.

about Habitat is that it allows for
freedom and creativity. However, I think
that people would also enjoy having
that freedom balanced by some structure

I'd say about 2 weeks is sufficient.

That way there's not too much in the
way of catching up for NEW folks as
they could look forward to a NEW event
coming up, and the 2 weeks `00likely would
serve to bore too many current folks.

do you really think a user is going
to pay nearly $5 an hour to watch
some stupid activity.

think about it.  if there are more
than 5 people in a reagon, most wont
even be able to F1  un-goast

each activity should last an hour or
less.  extremely long (and rewarding)
activities should be two to three
hours, and should be complete at the
end of the session.
Habitat is not suited to long-running
adventure games.  each activity is a
sub-game, and should be short term,
with immediate rewards.  Habitat itself
is the long-term game.

There needs to ba a wide variety of

Yes. As a Game Master, this and question
14 are right in my field. With the
exception of lacking (possibly) the
technical end of it (although I am a
recent graduate with a BS in EET), I
think I could be particularly helpful
with helping to design Adventure Areas,
such as multi-region "underground" or
"dungeon" adventures. (an expanded sewer
maze, for example).

Yes - however I'm not a programmer.

I'd have things like the beach with
"useable" sand..that could be
manipulated, affording contests like
castle building...etc.

I'd have woods that give a "woodsy"
effect..with less light..more like
a real woods...threatening animals,
surprises like an occasional woodsy
creature (unlike the chipmunks and
rabbit buried up to their heads)

I'd have "Avatar" trodden paths in
the wooded areas rather than brick
or other "streets."

The desert should be "useable", the
cacti utilized to fill one's bottle
or cup....a weakening of one's
general condition the longer one is
'lost in the desert', more realism.

Yes. This would relate to a previous
response concerning an adventure
area. Basically, it would be a cave
maze, reminiscent of AD&D adventures.
Choosing the correct path would lead
to treasure and other discoveries, the
wrong path would take you back outside,
to begin over again. I would be
hesitant to 'kill' an avatar for a
wrong move, although, this would de-
finitely add a considerable risk to
the challenge.

as part of the phantasy guild, our
purpose in habitat is to run adventures.
give folks something to do once the
novelty wears off.
projects of that sort are not easy under
any circumstance, never mind thelimited
abilities of habitat.
designing or creating new, personalized
regions would make the adventures much
more worthwhile.

    I would create regions to go along
with the game that I'm running.  A
dungeon setting is an easy and good
example.  The game players would actual
move their characters in a 3-D type of
environment and play the game thru the
actions of their Avatar.
    That is only one type of game... war
battles, stock market sim., races,
sports, and so forth can be done.
    The areas can also be public or
private.  Enter a Building downtown, and
walk into the game world, with as many
screen regions needed to play the event.
And a certain key would be needed to
enter, if some control of whose playing
is desired.

Realm of Wizardry
:
 Adjacent to a medival Realm, and
 with a generally medival outline.
 Limited to primitive and magical
 weapons only.
:
 Players could purchase an item to be
 worn, rather than carried.  This would
 enable them to use magical tools and
 weapons.  Spells would be contained
 in items and on scrolls, and would
 have a limit on the number of times
 that they could be used.
:
 General spells (teleportation,
 levitation, growth, strength, temporary
 invisibility, light healing) would
 be avialable in Vendos that were
 changed in shape and renamed.  Not all
 spells would be available in all
 locations.  Special spells would be
 available at all times in a hazardous
 location, one which would require
 basic spells to reach.
:
 High level spells would be the topic
 for periodic Organized Quests.
:
 The opportunity would be provided for
 non magical folks to participate,
 they could purchase magical protection
 that would blunt the effect of
 spells. Only the magic enabler or
 the magical protection could be worn,
 not both.  Non magical people would
 seek to destroy an Evil Wizard, or
 something similar to gain Tokens, or
 could gain Tokens working as bodyguards
 for wealthy magic users.

 would be instantly fatal.

 Most items from High Tech Realms
 would not operate here, and most of
 the magic above the level of the
 technological tools that are generally=
 available would function outside of
 this realm.
:
 No banks, Money Changers instead...
 They might look something like the
 Bureaucrats.  Pawn shops and low level
 magic shops at each ground entrance
 to the Realm.

Habitat, and knowing our members as
well as you do, about what percentage

If there is plenty of activity there,
I think that about 60% of them will
play regularly...which, I believe
comes to 36% of the total membership..
HOWEVER, I'm notoriously optimistic
about things like this :D

Hmmm, "regular" Habitat Players....

That's difficult, but perhaps 20-30%
of the adults might take part on
occasion (regular), just to meet other
friends there.

I think the younger members would
enjoy it, but unless they have
carte blanche on the use of Q-Link,
I think they'd be restricted due to its
potential for addiction.

Not knowing what you mean by "regular"
I'm somewhat at a loss.

ten to thirty percent, I think.
.
however, I think it is more probable
that you'll get a steady influx of first
time users that will play it for
several hours a day, a couple of days
a week, for a few weeks... then either
cut way back or stop using it entirely.
.
right now, finding out what all the
things do (and what your avatar does)
seems to be the most entertaining
thing.  once you reach saturation on
that, it would take a lot of interest
to get people to continue playing.

It's one thing to pay $29 for a game
and be able to play it at no further
cost...it's another to pay $29 and
have to pay 8 cents a minute to play
on top of it..no matter what the quality
of the game.

Since it was advertised about a year
ago as potentially selling for under
$15.00, it might be a bad move to make
the price higher at this time. 

Especially if consideration were made
re: the projected date(s) of its
availability.

If marketing feels that the online
cost of .08 per minute won't go over
well, perhaps part of the cost of
production ::could:: be made up by
charging more for the product, but I
think this wo`00uld be a wrong move.

I`00think it should sell for "under $15"
as was advertised last year.

  $10-$15 and here's why:
.
  Most people buy a $29 package to
  play and do just that, play it.
.
  There are no other costs (usually)
  incurred by its use.
.
  With Habitat, I think you should have
  the price relatively low as not to
  discourage those who complain about
  plus time. You have to consider that
  their cost does not end at $15.

$15-20. Possibly it should be  more, but
I think that's what people will pay.
This is different than going into a
store, buying a disk, and playing it
until the dog chews on it. People who
buy the Habitat disk are also going to
have to pay to use it.

I'd say $15-20...and not that it is
not worth more.  People won't be
willing to pay a full price for the
disk knowing that they're going to be
charged 8 cents/min. each time they
play the game.  So that reduces the
price you'd probably be able to charge
and most people would swallow.

Seriously...being a QRJ and seeing the
Casino disk go from $8 to nothing....
How long will the Hab disk be at it's
price?

I don't think that the disk should be
more than $10 in any case...It shouldn't
cost more than the signup for Q...

This would depend on some things...
Like Would manual and disk be the same
type as casino? or Q-Link software
packages? Then it would have to range
in that price range.
.
If the manual and disk is much more
involved then the price would be higher.

 Comment: Beta Casino disks were being

 expect this will happen again with
 Habitat.  I suspect the best strategy
 would be to get out the disks at cost,
 and make the profit in volume of time
 spent online.

Late last month, but I am a special

since my 128 is broken, and the fire
button on Port 1 on this 64 is not
working due to the CIA chip in the
64.  So when I enter Habitat, I can't
do anything but send ESP's...I can't
even read HabMail.
Assuming that were fixed, it would have

At the moment, even though I'm almost
always the only one in Habitat while I
am testing, I enjoy searching to see if
new areas have been put up. Since there
are no games, or particular tests, going
at the moment, there is not much else to
do. That, however, is fun enough for me.
(I just recently found the Hermitage and
I don't know HOW long that was there!)

 First off I think it can be a very good
service to provide our users. I see a
large potential in the game. I'm sure
that many testers, as well as myself,
have lessened our time in Habitat mainly
because of the fact that we spent so
many hours in there already. The first
two weeks I had access to Habitat I
spent 2-4 hours per night in there.
Since then my time spent in there has
steadily decreased. Two things will help
to increase the present testers testing
times, having more people in there (when
the Beta testers have access) and when
new things/areas become available. Just
meeting the new people will be a major
plus. As it is most of the time when I
get on there are only one or two other
people in there IF there is anyone at
all in there.

::Grin:: 

You'd have to know me to appreciate
my reply.

Let's call it dedication.  While I do
enjoy Habitat, even if I didn't, I've
accepted the responsibility of being
a tester, and am not the sort of person
to take responsibility lightly.

Often times I'm there alone, and even
if I'm not, the old "AvaHermit" acts
as if he WERE alone - searching the
streets and trash cans in search of
some valuable, hockable antique or a
used Kleenex.

I also keep track of how far (screen
changes) I can travel in an hour in
both "ghost state" and "regular". In
short, I entertain myself while
providing a service I agreed to.

I have to go in there every day to have

Seriously, I like it. I think with more
people in there, there will be enough
going on to hold someone's interest.
(But then you have to take into account
the fact that I haven't grown up yet.)
It really is kind of an extended PC,
with expanded opportunities for
interaction. It should interest
dedicated games players. Even
nest-builders should like it. 8)
You can play at being an entrepreneur,
or go into politics - whatever kind of
role-playing you want.

I am an active part of Q-Link and spend

sure that Habitat, when released, will
itself be an active part of the system
and I feel honored that I've been asked
to test it.
Personally, I'm not really INTO games
a lot, which explains some of my
previous responses.  But I do enjoy it
while I am there and will continue to
test as long as I'm here.

    The possibilites of HABITAT are
enormous, and like the idea of being a
part of it as it gets started.
    Ideas need to be worked out.  And
the more people doing things to those
ideas that shouldn't be done, prove how
workable the idea is.

 I love the concept of Habitat..and wish
 to see it succeed. I'm an avid adventur
 e gamer..and love the idea of quests
 as well as a way to *see* others online
:
 The reason I signed on to QLink last
 year, was entirely due to an Ad for
 Habitat. I guess my Bar became MY ver-
 sion of PC Habitat! ;DDD Last week I
 hung vines and filled the HotTub with
 Quicksand for Jungle Night! ;DDDD
:
 I would do almost anything to see HAB
 become a part of QLink.

I enjoy writing for the Rant. I also am
planning for the guild's involvement and
commitment to Habitat. If/when it goes
to full release, we will need to be set
with adventures and other activities.
I am also still testing because the
potential of it all impresses me.

about Habitat should be changed
so that you'd want to play again?

As I have said..the response time, the
pace of activities, including the pace
and slowness of conversation, the
regularity and length of disk loads...
These are the main factors that have
caused me to lose interest in HAB, and
therefore decrease my playing time,
freeing up my time to concentrate in
long, elabortae run-on sentences...  :D

I have not played Habitat since November
1st because frankly it does not seem
exciting to me.  For me, HABITAT is
aimless...  By that, I like to work to-
wards some goal and there seem to be
no goals in HABITAT, except to just
wander around and spend what little
tokens you have.   I've asked ORACLE for
ideas and things, but no response.
I've enjoyed very much seeing some of
the changes in my friends...the magic,
etc. but I couldn't try them out because
I could never figure out how any of thes
things worked.   I have a complete color
map of the Back 40 and the Forests...
done in little illustrated squares that
I worked hard on, but when I got done,
there was nothing to them.  I knew how
to move from place to place, but WHY?
There was a fairy/mushroom circle in the
forest...beautiful, but I could not
use it or figure out how.
.
And when I was in HABITAT, there seemed
to be no way to locate anyone or know
where everyone was, like in P.C....
I most often roved alone....so the
world seemed lonely.

check the Test Project Board and if
something was up, I'd pop in, otherwise
I'd just go about my business elesewhere

  The primary factor in not visiting on

time.

  If that was 100 Avatars on at the same
time, I would rate Habitat - GOOD
.
  If there were only 100 users...with
only ten or so on  -  POOR

That's difficult to answer, but I'd
say an average of 1.5 hours per day
since I've gotten 6.4.

40-60 I guess...it takes about 16 hours
to produce a RANT and there have been
two RANTS since 6.4 therefore at least
32 hours: probably 40 is close.

    which brings up a sore spot with me!
.
    My Avatar has developed a set of ...
errrr..... female attactments....
.
    I mean..... it's embrarassing
walking around looking like Dolly Parton
.
    I have to move around sideways so I
won't knock anything over.....
.
     And nowhere Downtown is a
foundation store, to give me the support
these things need!  They hurt just
hanging there.
