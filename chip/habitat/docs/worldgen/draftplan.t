Introduction

Obviously, we want Habitat to be both a popular and a financial success.
Speaking broadly, this means that the practical objectives for both the
Habitat world creation effort and subsequent world operations are to:

	1) Maximize the entertainment value of the experience for the players.

	2) Minimize the labor requirements for day-to-day management.

	3) Consistent with the above two goals, minimize the computer overhead
required to support the system.

Alas, these requirements are a bit too abstract for direct application.  This
document will present some objectives that are somewhat more concrete (i.e.,
more useful) along with the beginnings of a plan for meeting them.

At the most superficial level, creating the Habitat world consists of
designing a bunch of regions and generating the database entries that describe
them.  However, although our plan must incorporate this activity, it must also
take into account the broader context of the system.  The Habitat world is not
just a collection of database entries.  It is also a society made up of real
human beings.  Our plan must account for the shaping of this society in
addition to the shaping of the physical environment in which it resides.

Nevertheless, it is useful to consider for a moment the problem of region
design, since regions are the foundation of the Habitat world.  Given the
present state of our world construction toolkit, region creation is a
bottleneck in any effort to expand the size of the existing universe.  Region
creation is not only a time consuming and somewhat perilous activity, but also
requires specialized software and hardware which are only available here at
Lucasfilm.  In the long run, we must make the tools both safer and more
available.  However, for the present we need to have a strategy that minimizes
region creation, while recognizing that we can never be completely free of the
need for it.  We should try to develop activities which require small numbers
of regions, rather than demanding enormous new tracts of territory.

Another consideration that constrains any design is the amount of ongoing
support that will be required.  Best are things which can run themselves.
Second best are things that can be run by volunteer labor.  Worst are things
that require our own time and attention.  A major element of the strategy that
we will follow is to try to build a community.  If we succeed, then many of
the support issues will be taken care of automatically or semi-automatically
by the players themselves.  Part of our mission is to establish an environment
that encourages much of the support infrastructure to emerge spontaneously.

Habitat Communities

Our foundation for Habitat society is the idea of community.  A community is a
group of avatars bound together by geography and some degree of commonality of
belief about the kind of place they'd like Habitat to be.  A community
provides order to many otherwise disorderly aspects of the Habitat world.

A community consists of a collection of regions and a collection of avatars.
The regions are the territory that define the community's location and extent.
These regions will generally be contiguous, though there is no technical
reason for this constraint to be built in.  The avatars are the inhabitants of
the community.  Their behavior defines the community's character.  In
particular, the inhabitants are the ones who decide what the law of the land
is to be and how it will be enforced within the community's boundaries.

A community may be started either by the system operators (i.e., The Oracle)
or by the players themselves.  The first batch of towns will be established by
the system, and I expect that these will become the main inhabited areas of
the Habitat world.  However, I also expect that there will be an ever
increasing number of avatar-homesteaded splinter communities as the system
matures.

General Principles of Communities

In order to make communities practical, we need to establish a few basic
conventions.  A "community" is defined as a collection of regions.  Anyone
whose turf is among these regions is a "citizen".  Some communities my choose
to confer citizenship on particular non-resident avatars, but that is a civil
matter and doesn't effect the mechanism we are describing here.  The regions
of a community will generally be bounded by a "perimeter".  The perimeter is a
set of regions around the edges of the community's regular regions.  It is not
possible to enter or leave the community without passing through one of these
perimeter regions (except by long-distance teleport or magic).  The perimeter
allows us to establish a border and thereby control passage into and out of
the community.  By this means we can set up protected areas (such as the White
Sands object test range).  More importantly, it can provide the citizens of a
community with the the tool of banishment to help them enforce their laws.

A community's perimeter need not be large.  For example, even though
Populopolis consists of nearly 1000 regions right now (and growing), as the
city is currently laid out the perimeter is just two regions: the places where
Woods Rd heads out into the countryside to the north and south.

Within the regions of a community, the community itself determines what the
laws and rules are to be, subject only to the constraints of the Terms of
Service and external (i.e., "real world") laws and rules.  Of course, the laws
of a community are also limited in a practical sense by what is possible
within Habitat.  In particular, responsiblity for policing the community and
enforcing the laws is vested in the citizens themselves.  We will not enforce
their laws for them.  We will provide a set of tools that can be used to aid
in enforcement, but it is up to the players to use them or not as they see
fit.  Also, the mechanism by which the laws (and rulers, if any) are
determined is also up to the citizens (this means that all possible forms of
government are possible, from democracy to totalitarian dictatorship to
anarchy).  The only intervention in this process which we will make is to
insist that each community place a notice in its perimeter regions stating the
basic rules and laws that apply inside.

We will also require that no community have the power to hold an avatar inside
its perimeter against his will (i.e., anyone who wishes to leave a particular
community may do so).  Within this rule, communities are free to run their
systems of justice as they wish.  They may, for example, make entry into the
community contingent on participation in the community's system of justice.  A
community *may* forcibly limit an avatar's movements so long as the avatar
chooses to remain inside the community.  In other words, you can throw
somebody in jail, thereby removing him from the local society.  For example,
he might be presented with the choice between staying in jail (and thus in
town), serving out his sentence and returning to normal life in the community,
or leaving the community entirely, never allowed to return.  

Default Communities

The initial communities established by the system will be vaguely democratic,
with codes of law of the sort that Americans are used to.  They will then be
free to evolve from there (though communities that drift too far from the
mainstream may have to be taken off the list of places where new avatars are
hatched).  What follows will describe the sort of "default" communities that
we will establish.

Politics

Offices such as Sheriff will be elected, at least in the beginning.  The
default Habitat community has little need for elected officials outside of the
law enforcement sphere.  However, people being what they are, it is likely
that the inhabitants will want to be able to elect a mayor, town council, and
the like.  We therefor need a means of conducting elections.  Our experience
with the recent Sheriff's election in Populopolis gives us a good model,
however.

Democracy requires more than just balloting.  There also needs to be a process
for determining who is eligible to vote and who has already voted, for
determining what the candidates and the issues are going to be, and for
determining when and where the election is to be held.  There needs to be an
information mechanism so that everyone knows that there is to be an election,
when and where to go to vote, what the rules are, and so on.  Furthermore, the
"unofficial" informational elements of a proper campaign are probably
desirable: press coverage, debates, advertising, public speeches, and so on.

For our Sheriff's election, most of the decisions regarding when, where, how
and so on were made by us.  Everyone currently in the world was eligible to
vote, and the candidates chose themselves.  In the future, the decisions will
have to be made by officials of whatever passes for a community's government.
They can decide among themselves using whatever procedure they care to agree
upon.

We set up a polling place (for Populopolis only one was required) that was a
region containing 3 magic push-buttons on the wall, one for each candidate,
which were labeled with the candidates' names.  It also contained a sign
announcing the election and a plaque with detailed instructions.  Pressing one
of the buttons incremented a counter associated with that button and set a bit
in the avatar record that prevented further voting.  Secret ballots were
automatic, as one's voting action was not broadcast to others in the region.
At the end of the election, the counter on each button indicated the vote
count for the associated candidate.  We simply noted these counts and
published them.

To make this mechanism available to the players directly, we need to provide
them with some special capabilities: a way of setting the labels on the
buttons (and of determining the number of buttons that will be placed on the
ballot for a given election), a way of setting the sign and instructions in
the polling region, a way of clearing the counters on the voting buttons, and
a way of clearing the "has voted" bit associated with all eligible voter
avatars.  Also required is a way to turn the voting buttons on and off (so
that the election can be conducted at controlled times) and a way of reading
out the final results.  All of these can be implemented with a few special
magic items.

I would propose that for future elections we require voters to register.
Registering simply requires going to a public registration place where there
will be a magic button or lever that will clear the "has voted" bit
(registration will be disabled while an election is in progress, of course).
This mechanism allows us to avoid having to run any kind of global filter on
the avatar database to mess with the voting control bit.

The conventional mechanisms of the Habitat press can be used for publicity and
advertising.  Candidates can hold their own campaign rallies, while the
community can form a "League Of Avatar Voters" to conduct debates.  Election
officials will be responsible for distributing information about dates and
procedures by informing the press and by placing notices on official public
bulletin boards and the like.

Community Institutions

In addition to the legal and governmental institutions touched on above, other
organizations are desirable for a community to really work as the sort of
place that we want it to be in order to hold peoples' interest.  In
particular, we need communications and information distribution channels,
economic entities, and recreational facilities.

The Press

One of the most important institutions of the community, as we have
discovered, is the press.  This is because much of the support that a player
needs in order to cope successfully with the Habitat universe comes in the
form of information.  A regular news service is an invaluable way to keep
people informed as to the goings on in a community.  In the default
communities the press will be a semi-official house organ.  It carries not
only the news and views provided by its editorial department, but also
material provided by us, the system operators, for distribution to the avatar
public.  Default communities will always require at least one such officially
connected publication, although additional competitive publications are
certainly allowed (even encouraged).

One of the ways a community can drift away from the mainstream is to place
controls on the press within it.  Such communities might deliberate choose,
for example, to isolate themselves from the system's official news sources.
That is their choice.  Such communities will probably have to be taken off the
list of new avatar hatching sites, however.

To operate a publishing business is currently rather awkward, due to the
limitations of the text interface that Habitat provides.  Unfortunately, we do
not have the memory space or the programmer time to implement any more
sophisticated text editing capabilities in the C64 Habitat software.  However,
there are a few items which our experience publishing the Rant have taught us
will be useful and which we intend to add at our first opportunity.  The first
of these is a copying machine.  This is a device that makes duplicates of the
text on a piece of paper.  This is to reduce the amount of hand-transfer of
written material that will be required in an editorial office.

An item that will be almost mandatory is a binding machine.  This is a device
which takes a collection of pieces of paper (and possibly books) and creates a
new book/newspaper object with the combined text of the inputs.  We currently
do this by hand.  We have the Rant editor place a series of pieces of paper
into a predesignated container, and then we use our Stratus database
manipulation utilities manually to extract the contents of these sheets of
paper and incorporate them into a new document.  It is a tedious and time
consuming process ripe for automation.  A useful companion to the binding
machine would be a bursting machine, which performs the opposite function:
takes a book or magazine and generates a bunch of sheets of paper with the
individual pages.  The burster is less important to have than the binding
machine, however.



community activities
news and information
law and order
commerce
the oracle
puzzles and games
adventures, travel and exploration

Since we are trying to form a community, it may be useful to take the idea of
community as our starting point for design, instead of trying to just create
regions willy-nilly.  A community consists of citizens and institutions,
together with the physical plant that allows the institutions to have places
to operate and the citizens places to live.


The institutions of a community serve to fill the needs of the members of the
community.  In order to design institutions for Habitat, we need to consider
what the "needs" of Avatars are.  As simulated creatures, Avatars have few if
any true needs per se.  However, the players behind the Avatars do have
psychological needs and wants which they are trying to fill by playing Habitat
-- it's the reason they're here in the first place.  Thus, our design problem
comes down to considering what we think the players' needs and wants are and
then building the environment to satisfy them.


As I see it, these are the things that people are seeking:


- Social contact: companionship, friendship, group acceptance, and romance

- Identity: establishing a personal identity in terms of Avatar appearance,
personality, and place

- Entertainment: adventure, puzzles, shows, games, literature

- Communications: both point-to-point and broadcast; both real-time and time-
delayed

- Information: news about the people and events of Habitat, past, present and
future

- Support: items, services and information that help people cope with the
situations and problems they are confronted with in both Habitat and the real
world as they try to fill the above needs


The above categories are not exclusive; the boundary lines between them are
admittedly fuzzy.  No item stands by itself, but is interpreted in the context
of the whole system.  For example, a newspaper provides both entertainment and
news, while a club-house supports both social contact and the sense of
personal identity.


Here is a list of real-world institutions that might be applicable to Habitat.
This list is not intended to be exhaustive, nor do we necessarily intend to
include ALL of these things.  It is simply a starting point from which to
figure out our plan.

Couriers                  Manufacturers


Of course, in addition to the above list there will likely be a number
institutions that are unique to Habitat, with few analogs in the real world.


While each of these institutions raises some unique issues of its own, there
are some common questions that are applicable to all of them:


Is it needed?  What purpose does it serve in Habitat?  How does it fit in with
the other institutions, existing or planned?  How many people are needed to
run it?  Can it be automated or do actual people have to manage it?  Who (if
people are needed) will run it?  How are those running it to be chosen?  Do
the people running it need to be system insiders or can anyone do it?  How
will it work in the Habitat universe?  Can we make it fun or is it unavoidable
drudgery?  Are any special regions needed?  Any new classes of objects?  New
types of magic?  Special database filters or other support tools?  How many
institutions of this type are required or allowed?  Who makes global decisions
about this class of institutions?  Who is subject to this institution?  What
are its powers, privileges and responsibilities?  Are there any special rules
we must impose to regulate it?
