The Habitat world is made from three ingredients that are combined to meet our
ultimate goal, which is to provide entertaining things for the players to do.
The three ingredients are:

	1) People -- The players, the operators, and us.

	2) Places -- Towns, residential areas, business districts, wilderness,
		forests, deserts, dungeons, and other more specialized
		regions.

	3) Things -- Treasure, magic items, tools, documents, and scenery of
		all sorts.

These ingredients must be combined to form an effective whole that results in
a good time for the players in the world.  If the combination is not
effective, what we have is a dead universe, a museum at best.

An important consideration, however, is always that we incur a cost for
providing any of these things.  With the exception of providing the players
themselves, who pay for the privilege, all world creation activity consumes
time, effort and therefor money.  The fundamental problem that faces us is how
to get the most "bang for the buck".

Another cost consideration is the amount of ongoing support that any given
feature of the world will require.  Best are things which can run themselves.
Second best are things that can be run by volunteer labor.  Worst are things
that require our own time and attention.  Our strategy for coping with this is
to try to build a community.  If we succeed, then many of the support issues
will be taken care of automatically by the players themselves.  Part of our
objective is to establish an environment in which much of the support
infrastructure will emerge spontaneously.

Since we are trying to form a community, it may be useful to take the idea of
community as our starting point for design, instead of trying to just create
regions willy-nilly.  A community consists of citizens and institutions,
together with the physical plant that allows the institutions to have places
to operate and the citizens places to live.

The institutions of a community serve to fill the needs of the members of the
community.  In order to design institutions for Habitat, we need to consider
what the "needs" of Avatars are.  As simulated creatures, Avatars have few if
any true needs per se.  However, the players behind the Avatars do have
psychological needs and wants which they are trying to fill by playing Habitat
-- it's the reason they're here in the first place.  Thus, our design problem
comes down to considering what we think the players' needs and wants are and
then building the environment to satisfy them.

As I see it, these are the things that people are seeking:

- Social contact: companionship, friendship, group acceptance, and romance
- Identity: establishing a personal identity in terms of Avatar appearance,
	personality, and place
- Entertainment: adventure, puzzles, shows, games, literature
- Communications: both point-to-point and broadcast; both real-time and time-
	delayed
- Information: news about the people and events of Habitat, past, present and
	future
- Support: items, services and information that help people cope with the
	situations and problems they are confronted with in both Habitat and
	the real world as they try to fill the above needs

The above categories are not exclusive; the boundary lines between them are
admittedly fuzzy.  No item stands by itself, but is interpreted in the context
of the whole system.  For example, a newspaper provides both entertainment and
news, while a club-house supports both social contact and the sense of
personal identity.

Here is a list of real-world institutions that might be applicable to Habitat.
This list is not intended to be exhaustive, nor do we necessarily intend to
include ALL of these things.  It is simply a starting point from which to
figure out our plan.

Couriers                  Manufacturers

Of course, in addition to the above list there will likely be a number
institutions that are unique to Habitat, with few analogs in the real world.

While each of these institutions raises some unique issues of its own, there
are some common questions that are applicable to all of them:

Is it needed?  What purpose does it serve in Habitat?  How does it fit in with
the other institutions, existing or planned?  How many people are needed to
run it?  Can it be automated or do actual people have to manage it?  Who (if
people are needed) will run it?  How are those running it to be chosen?  Do
the people running it need to be system insiders or can anyone do it?  How
will it work in the Habitat universe?  Can we make it fun or is it unavoidable
drudgery?  Are any special regions needed?  Any new classes of objects?  New
types of magic?  Special database filters or other support tools?  How many
institutions of this type are required or allowed?  Who makes global decisions
about this class of institutions?  Who is subject to this institution?  What
are its powers, privileges and responsibilities?  Are there any special rules
we must impose to regulate it?
