Subject: Habitat meetings at Quantum, 11/3
Status: R


Here is a summary of our conversations:

1.  In addition to the elevator, we need to specify other objects that will
be part of the field update test.  What else will be installed and/or deleted?

2.  Quantum does not want to buy a C compiler.  Marc does not think it is
necessary.  He sees our trying to require such a thing as engineering
interference.

3.  We need to define the Basic Turf Set to facilitate the clearing of
inactive users.  What is in the default Turf Environment?

4.  We agreed to turn all logged out users to ghosts for the time being,
rather than leave them turned to stone.  We need to revise the manual
accordingly.  This is subject to change (easily) during beta test.

5.  Several issues about the Oracle and/or Mail:

	a.  How do answers get to users?  In the Mail system?  Do you have
to go home to your Turf to get your response?

	b.  Can you use ESP from the Oracle?

	c.  Can we make a special login-in disk that allows a player to
login as a particular incarnation of the Oracle, for real-time Oracle
communications?

	d.  Can we make a mailbox in someone's pocket?  (Quantum believes
that Turfs are not going to be used much at all.... that since there is
virtually nothing you can do there, once people leave they will rarely come
back, except maybe to store things.  Therefore, it is cumbersome and counter
to the design intent to make them go back just to get the mail....).  Can we
make a "book of letters" in someone's pocket, where mail gets delivered to?

6.  The Avatar Directory, if it exists, should probably not be an object you
carry, but rather something in a particular location.  Perhaps they exist at
TelePort booths?  In any case, this is a low priority at this point, and we
should not worry about it overmuch.  We will defer a decision until later.
Maybe a "Who's Who" of Avatars in the Hall of Records?

7.  Tom Canaday is going to the Habitat SysOp.

8.  QL has finished the Oracle software, but is unsure about the powers of
the Oracle.  There is currently no way for an Oracle to affect an avatar
(like give him/her a Goathead....  They need specification on this.

9.  Janet says she has said to us that GHU is clearly not acceptable as it
currently is proposed, because the powers are too pervasive.  We need to
define and specify!  What can the Oracle do?  (The fact that she had said
that was news to me.  Does anyone know about this?)

10.  Regarding Avatar death:  What happens when people die?  Since we don't
have exit interviews at the moment, do they just go back to PC?  Are they
sent to their Turf?  This is an important design decision.  Also, apparently
due to the existence of ghosting, it is likely no one will ever die?  You
can always "go ghost" when you are in a threatening situation?  QL reports
that there are virtually no guns in the world now anyway.  Is this being
fixed?  We need to specify death and exit interviews.

11.  There seems to be a problem with the revised downtown.  First,
apparently they did not know we were undertaking such a massive revision.
Did we tell them?  Also, Janet reports some difficulty in uploading part of
a region, or a region revision where you are supposed to keep some stuff,
and replace some other stuff.

12.  The question was raised as to whether we had over-designed the existing
Turfs.  (Apparently there are some that don't work right because there is
too much stuff, or foregrounds and backgrounds are set up right.... Do we
know about this?)  Do we need to replace all the existing Turfs with a
simpler model?

13.  The RANT:  Marc wonders if we and they have a completely different idea
of what it is.  Marc says it can't be a long, linear, text thing in Habitat.
You can have such a thing in the Just For Fun listing of the Rant, but due
to text transmission problems and heirarchical menu problems, the Rant in
the world will be nothing more than a page of one-liners.  Does this match
what we are thinking?  (Apparently not....)  Can we make the Rant a
container, and use the contents as objects?  Or can we change the user
interface on the book object to allow for menu-level inquiry, so that people
can select from a table of contents?  If the Rant is expected to be dynamic,
then it should be delivered to pockets as an object.  If it is dynamic, they
people only buy it once.  If it is not, then we have a huge garbage
collection problem for all the old Rants....

14.  We have discussed a "world status" screen that greets everyone each
time they log in.... telling them what's new in the world, and other
essential information.  I thought we had agreed to do this.  Janet had
apparently not heard of such a thing.  We need to clear this up.

15.  There are too few ATM's, too few pieces of paper, and too few
mailboxes, according to QL reports.  Mail seems to be a big problem for
them.  The don't think it is useful.  (This is partly a design issue--they
see the essential design elements of Habitat to be communication between
people.  They think we are designing unneccessary limits on communication
into the world, and that may cause us big problems.  Use of mail and paper
are examples.  They think that finding and sending mail are sufficiently
cumbersome as to be almost useless in game play.)

16.  The Head shop is still blocked up.  No one knows how bad it will be
when we actually get it running.  Do we know why it is not working now?

17.  Regarding Coming Attractions:  They need to know what is required for
each of the items on the Coming Attractions document.  Every time we say
"special programming required," they need to know who is going to do it, and
by when....  They question whether some of that stuff is needed for beta,
because some of it is so new to them....

18.  Regarding Adventure Master powers.  We need some special doors that
only Adventure Masters can enter, to allow us to limit access to certain
areas.

19.  There is need to clarify how objects are cloned or copied, both for
vendos and for adventures that are object-based.  For example, if someone
finds a clue to an adventure, does it get replaced for someone else, or is
it only one person's game?

20.  Home decoration, jukeboxes, and keys were elements that there seemed to
be confusion about.  We should make sure the organizations have the same
understanding.

21.  The intelligent counter in the Pawnshop apparently does not work.  When
will it?

22.  Theatres vs. Auditorium.  They seemed surprised by all of our
theatre-based additions.  Marc pointed out that we can't have any
interactions with the audience using the current ghost system, so we can do
auditorium functions.  I told them I thought that what you were thinking was
more theatre-like.  People could watch, but were not expected to actively
participate.  Queueing people to appear in person on a game show or talk
show needs to be addressed however.

23.  Where does the Arcade fit?  This was another "surprise" to them.  When
will it work?  What will it do?  What about the Stock Exchange?  When will
it work?  What kinds of books are in the Library?  Who is doing the book
management program (or whatever)?

24.  They need specifics on the functioning of City Hall.  Who is doing it,
by when?  Is it a beta function?  Who runs scheduling to rent a storefront?

25.  Marc reports apparently major crashes of the C-64, with screen garbage,
during the last weekend test.  This he says indicates problem with C-64, not
with host.  (This is probably old news, but I am reporting because we
discussed it.)  Janet says we don't have enough (any?) error messages, that
they have complained about this before, and we have said we can't do it.
Therefore, the user does not know what is going on when it crashes.  Marc
said he had to re-boot four times in thirty minutes.

26.  Marc says we should have a rental dataline monitor to see if we are
sending garbage out.  I have never heard of such a thing.  Do we need it?

27.  Janet says she thinks the easiest way to get capacity handling fixed is
for Chip to write it, rather than for Chip to try to explain it to her.  She
is at this point suspicious of how much time it will take to explain and
re-explain and de-bug it if she does it.  Has this been discussed?


Summary:  They think the project is sufficiently far from release-state that
February is the earliest we could be done, and that is if everything goes
right (which it never has to this point).  They are concerned that there are
big areas of unknowns, that we won't discover until we get the thing
working, and that some big re-design may be possible.  For instance, they
think that if we can't get the region transition thing speeded up, we will
have a significant game play problem.  

The communication channel from now on is going to be with Cathy Anderson on
their side, and Nancy on our side.  That of course does not substitute for
direct technical discussions between any of us and Janet, Marc, or whomever
regarding development and debugging.  But the design discussions need to be
focused on Cathy.  Communication is essential.  There are too many
ambiguities to ensure that we are using our time efficiently at this point.

Please review this and then let's discuss anything that is not clear and/or
resolved.
