Notes from group brainstorming meeting on MicroCosm, 19-March-86

Present: Aric, Ron, Randy, Charlie, Jim, Noah, me

I started by bringing up the Economic Problem: if we are going to simulate a
monetary economy we have to have some basis for the currency.  In the "real"
world, people work at jobs and produce goods and services, in turn for which
they are paid money with which they purchase the goods and services of others.
The question is, how do folks in the MicroCosm world get their funds?  Having
their avatars work at avatar jobs is not only pointless, but probably not fun.
Furthermore, it pushes peoples' behavior in a particular direction (economic
behavior) that may be satisfying to some but certainly will not be satisfying
to all.  Economic behavior should certainly be an option, but it should be
just an option, not a requirement.

Several strategies were raised:

One proposal was simply do away with money.  This handily answers the income
problem, but cancels a number of other options in so doing.  In particular,
the only form of trade is barter, which makes it difficult to have such fun
things as stores (especially automated ones run by the system).  Of course,
stores are not necessary, but they would add a little variety and provide a
handy mechanism for introducing new things into the world.  The consensus was
that doing away with money entirely was not the way to go.

Another suggestion is that when you log in it's your avatar's day off.  He (or
she) works at a regular job when you are not logged on and earns a salary.
This provides a justification for just giving the player some working capital,
but seems a little contrived.  Also, there is an unfortunate meta-level
disincentive to log in (since not being logged in earns money for your
avatar).

A slight variation on this idea which I find much more pleasing is outlined by
the following scenario:  The MicroCosm is a special place.  They don't let in
just any of the hoi-polloi.  Rather, like certain night clubs and foreign
countries, you have to have a minimum amount of wealth before they will even
let you through the door.  Fortunately for you, you have this trust fund left
to you by your rich, eccentric Aunt Zelda which is sufficient to get you past
the doorman.  This trust fund is in an interest-bearing bank account, and you
can spend or save the interest money as you wish.  However, you are never
allowed to touch the principal, so you are guaranteed a certain minimum income
that is not extravagent but which is enough to cover your subsistence-level
expenses.  The trick is: everybody has a rich Aunt Zelda.  Also, for purposes
of computing the interest on your bank account, only the time you are logged
in counts as "real".  I.e., you accrue interest while you are logged in, but
the clock stops the minute you sign off.

Another suggestion (which I think works best as an adjunct to the above
system) is that we *do* have jobs.  However, the jobs are optional, and they
are fun sub-games unto themselves.  For example, you could be a guard at the
city gates.  Your job is to let the citizens past and repell the bandits.  The
host system generates the bandits, and we make Shoot-At-The-Bandits a
sub-game.  To augment this we could have a time-clock object and a time-card
object.  When you go to work you "punch-in" and when you decide you are bored
and want to leave you can "punch-out".  You can then take your time-card to
the city hall and get paid for your time.  This mechanism has a couple of nice
properties.  First of all, the time-card can be an independent object and so
becomes a valuable in its own right.  Someone could rob you and take it away
from you and go try to collect your pay.  You, on the other hand, could then
lie in wait at city hall and try to catch the thief.  Also, there is no
requirement that the time-card/time-clock belong to the State (i.e., to the
system).  They could belong to other players or to communities of avatars.

Yet another source of income (and variety in the world) would be to allow
avatars to actually produce goods.  We could have factory-machines that make
stuff.  Such machines could work in a number of different possible ways.  One
would be to have a variety of dedicated, special purpose machines.  For
example there could be a gun making machine and a telephone making machine and
a shoe making machine.  The machine is a box with a hopper on the top.  You
put three medium sized rocks and a Fnork-berry bush into the hopper, turn the
crank, and out pops a new pair of shoes.  Another variation would be for the
device to act rather like a Xerox machine: you put some object into the hopper
labeled MASTER and some raw materials into the hopper labeled INGREDIENTS,
turn the cranks, and now you have two of whatever object you gave it (it is
unclear what would happen if you tried to duplicate an avatar!).  A third
variation would be for the machine to be a sort of alchemical puzzle: it has a
bunch of different knobs, dials and switches, and depending on the setting of
the controls, the particular assortment of raw ingredients, the time of day
and the phase of the moon, it produces *something*.  Of course, if you do it
wrong it produces something worthless, like brown sludge.  Or maybe it will
produce something BAD (or just explode).  And certain items of manufacture
require certain rare or expensive raw materials which you have to go out into
the world and find.  Also, there are no instructions.  Mastery of the factory
machine becomes a genuine wizard's art, for the attraction of those players
who are into playing wizard.

Several people came up with the idea that we should have a "Hall of Fame" that
posts vital statistics on other players in a variety of different areas.  This
would give people some feedback on "how they are doing" with respect to
everyone else.  Providing a bunch of different statistics could allow people
to find different areas to pursue, if they are interested in getting into the
Hall of Fame.  For example, we could post lists of the ten avatars who

	are the wealthiest
	have been killed the most times
	have the longest average lifespans
	are the largest land-owners
	have killed the most dragons (Charlie *really* wants there to be
								dragons!)
	have discovered the most new territory
	etc.

The more things (within reason), the better.  The records would be adjusted
continuously and automatically by the system (we could also have a "Hall of
Shame" listing the avatars coming out at the bottom in these statistics).  The
effect would be to give players identifiable targets to strive for (e.g., "I
want to collect the world's biggest ball of string") in the same way that the
Guinness Book of World's Records does in the real world.  Some of these
records would have the effect of casting an unwelcome spotlight on certain
individuals, as, for example, in the Old West you didn't want to become known
as the best gunfighter.  

The issue of protection from violence and mayhem was raised.  The consensus
was that there should be some way for non-violently inclined players to avoid
the violently inclined ones.  Noah made the suggestion (based, I think, on the
work he and Ron are doing on a space game layered on top of the MicroCosm
universe) that there be a State, run by the system.  Certain parts of the
world are State controlled.  These areas are automatically operating Weapons
Free Zones -- check your guns at the door.  Nobody can get in while armed.  Of
course, there is a price to living in the State: you have to pay taxes: some
fraction of your bank account is collected every-so-often.  Running between
the State controlled zones are State operated transport lines.  These are safe
but expensive.  You can take private transport at much lower cost but
consequently greater risk.  You can avoid paying taxes by homesteading an area
outside the State controlled zones, but then you have to protect yourself.  Of
course, you could band together with other players for mutual protection and
form a new town of your own.  We would provide various security measures that
would provide various levels of protection.  For example, you could put up a
fence around your town with a special gate that has a weapons detector in it.
For a few more tokens you can buy a protection-field generator.  Of course,
for each of these measures there is a more expensive counter-measure, and for
each counter-measure there is an even more expensive counter-counter-measure.
The only absolute security is with the State, but some will feel the price for
absolute security is just too high: you have to go outside to get VERY
wealthy, for example.

Another thing that could happen would be for a bunch of people in an area to
get together and decide to annex themselves into the State.

I brought up the issue of what happens when you die.  I described the scenario
where you are (sometimes) interviewed by God, where you get to plead your case
and have judgement passed upon your actions.  This went over pretty well.
Charlie suggested that you should be able to leave a will with instructions
about what should happen if you are killed.  One possibility would be to let
you write your own obituary, which gets published in the newspaper if you die.
You could leave messages like "I am about to visit So-and-so who might try to
kill me" as a form of insurance.  Of course you could also leave such messages
as a form of deception -- kill yourself and let others "avenge" you by beating
up on the hapless victim at whom you have pointed the finger.

You register your will at the Hall of Records.  The Hall of Records also keeps
property deeds, so that you can homestead unowned property and claim it as
your own, as well as letting you transfer title when you sell something.
Perhaps we should maintain some sort of requirement that, as with real
homesteading, that you somehow improve or use your property, or it reverts to
being unowned again.

Charlie ceaselessly brought up the subject of being able to be some other sort
of being than an avatar.  In particular, he wants to be a dragon.  There did
seem to be some support for the idea that there should at least be some sort
of Horrible Monster to wreak havoc.  Also, having other kinds of critters
gives you the option of being able to transform players from one type to
another (transformation being another one of Charlie's obsessions).  For
example, misuse of certain magical items could turn you into a toad for a
while.

We discussed the notion of avatar "health".  The current avatar definition
specifies a 'health' property, but the only thing that now matters is whether
or not it is zero.  health=0 means you're dead, health>0 means you're alive.
Clearly, we would like to have a broader interpretation of this, so that
intermediate values could represent wounded or diseased states.  We could then
have cures for these which would make you all better again.
