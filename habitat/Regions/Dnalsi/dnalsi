AMULET OF SALESH STILL MISSING!

   There has been a major development in
the famous Great Amulet Caper today: The
thieves were found guilty of grand theft
magic, and sentenced to 5 years in The Void.

   As you will remember, the Great Not-So-Wise
man, Daden Salesh, had his Great Amulet of Wonderous
Worth stolen last week. Salesh, being a powerful
but clumsy wizard tried to activate a homing-return
spell to attempt to retrieve his valuable trinket.
The result was the accidental porting of the thieves
to his home, somewhere in the Back-Fourty.

   The Amulet is still missing, and all attempts by 
the law to extract information from the evil doers
were in vain. It seems that the Amulet will
remain forever lost.

-----------------------------------------------------

At the not-so-wise man's house, somewhere in the back-40:

		A Sign: "Not in right now.
			 Buy Notes & Map."
		A vending machine containing:
			A Map (see attached)	price: 10t
			A piece of paper	price: 1t
Optional:
		Daden Salesh himself (whenever I'm logged in)


Text of the note:
I am the POWERFUL WIZARD 'SALESH'!
(really I am!)
I'll start with the good stuff:

My estate will pay the sum of NNNNN tokens
to each member of the first team to find 
my amulet and return it to me.

In my interrigations of the thief-scum
that I ported back here with my WONDEROUS
powers, I extracted several pieces
of information you may find helpful:

1) They had a map of D'nalsi Island with them.
(I have taken the liberty of making copies of
the map for you, availible for a small fee...)

2) As I snatched the map away, the uglier of the
two of them said "You'll never find it!HA HA HA!" and flashed
a sign of some sort: He formed a triangle with the
thumbs and index fingers of each hand, palms forward.

The only thing I can think of to get you on your
way is: there is no form of water transportation in
the world, so they must have ported there.

Equip well & Good Luck

Text of appropriate books:

History of Teleport:
	Page 1
	    The teleport was invented by the great
	tinkerer avatar Foontrafian Subtrax. It took
	many years to perfect the technique, and many
	a test animal was lost to the void. It is still
	rumored to this day that, when the conditions
	are JUST RIGHT when teleporting, an avatar
	may end up with animal parts in place of his normal
	limbs and/or head. Rest assured that this is
	ONLY a rumor.
	Reguardless of the rumored risks, the teleport
	has become the single most valued addition to
	the universe, opening whole vista's of places
	to explore. Socially the 'Port', as it is called
	by most everyone, was to restructure the world
	forever. THANK YOU Foontrafian!
	
	Page 2
		How a Port address is chosen:

	Most often, all teleport booths are registered
	in the Teleport-Book, published in every major
	city. There are some standards loosly adheared to
	when generating a port address:

	Where			Style
	------------		---------------
	Streets			Cityname Streetname
	Intersection		Cityname Streetname & Streetname
	Downtown		CItyname 'Downtown' or 'Plaza'
	Forests			Nickname
	Islands			Ilename
	Deserts			Noone goes here anyway!

	(If Cityname is ommitted, the local city will be assumed.)

	People have been known to spend large amounts
	of money to buy personal booths and NOT register
	them. These booths useally have customized addresses
	that have personal meaning to the owner (so the
	address is not forgotten)




History of Organized Crime:

	    Organized crime has never really been a
	big problem. There is only one gang, and it
	is now almost extinct. If it has a name, none
	of it's members have ever spoken it publicly.
	The only way they can identify each other is
	by some secret signal.
	
	   The gang (as we'll call them) was formed 
	by a few avatars bent on self-destruction. All
	but a few members have been caught, (easily)
	tried, and sent into the void. The crimes are
	always mis-handled or bungled in some major way.

	   One good example of thier foolhardiness is
	reflected in thier choice of security control:
	They used only 2 styles of locks & keys...
	Styles #xxxxx and #yyyyy. Needless to say
	these are the two most common locks in the
	known world, and you can see why they would have
	financial problems.....

------------------------------------------------------

At Randy's Adventure Emporium:

	Kaki walls
	(should look like either a cave or a battle zone)

	Vendos selling:

		Shovels
		Torches
		Knives ? (maybe these should be elsewhere or
			   not included -means scratching monster-)
		Club ? (safe as knife)
		Bags (Backpack?)
		Books (survival tips booklet ALSO AVAIL AT LIBRARY)
		Bottles
		Escape Devices
		Matchbook
		Kaki Shirt & Pants
		Teddy Bear (good for laughs)
		Towel
		
------------------------------------------------------

At Lefty's Locksmithery:

	'Looks': Grimy Dirty place.


	Vendos (each has a sign):
		"Replacement Keys #1000 & #2000" (two keys)
		"Replacement Keys #32767 & #255" (two keys)
		"Lock Boxes" (whatever box styles we have - NO CHEST)
			Inside each box is it's key.

------------------------------------------------------

On D'nalsi Island:

	The grass regions are oriented so the player
can see the mountains rising in the distance as they
get closer. The beach regions ALL face the water.
There are no mountain regions, the are considered to be
impassible. ALL regions contain rocks of variaing sizes
lying about randomly. One of the cave entrances can be
seen from grassland region 62. If possible this release,
the caves should be dark, requiring a light source.

SPECIAL REGIONS:
	The grassland region 2A contains a teleport,
there should be no rock in the region & no mountains
in the background. (If fact regions 19, 29-C, 39-C should
have no mountains in the backdrop, but face that direction)

	The Beach region 92 contains a paritally completed
Oracle (no cherebum) and a Sign 'ASK, and if I'm not busy..."

	The Beach region 4C is the 'W' region from it's
a mad mad mad mad world. (Besides rocks, there is nothing here.)

	The caves are connected normally but the
orentation changes almost every cave, so that withou a compass
It could be hard to find your way around.

	At cave2_20, there are a few things of note: Besides some
small rocks, there are 3 rocks (two large, one meduim) that form
a triangle, with it's apex against the back wall. If the center of
the trangle is a hole. It conatains a note: "WRONG". The back
wall has an invisible cave (small sheet of glass?) just above
the apex of the triangle. 'Go' here and you will enter the
Secret Chamber!

	At cave2_30 is the secret chamber. No rocks.
Just a hole, containing A chesk with lock #2000. In the
Chest is the Amulet Of Salesh
