Nobuo san,

I have looked into the list of missing files that you sent to Randy.  Here is
the story:

Some of the files are QuantumLink proprietary, and I can't give them to you (I
can't even read them myself any more).  They relate to aspects of the
QuantumLink system itself, not to Habitat, so the fact that you don't have them
should not prove to be a problem.

Some of the files are PL/1 "include" files.  The Stratus PL/1 compiler enforces
the convention that all include files have names that end in ".incl.pl1".  It
will add this extension to any include name that doesn't already have it.  Thus
if you see the line

	%include 'foo';

in one place and then

	%include 'foo.incl.pl1';

in another, they refer to the same file.  Several of the files on the list fall
into this category, where you thought you were missing the 'foo' file, but you
actually have the 'foo.incl.pl1' file on the original tape.

Some of the files are ones that we gave you listings for but were not on the
tape because they were simply example that we did not think you would need them
in machine-readable form.  However, if you want them, you've got them.

Finally, some files were really missing.

As you requested, I will have a tape for you at our meeting at Skywalker on
November 10.

Notes:

#1: A couple of files are quite obsolete.  Nothing in them is ever referred to
by the software, and references to them may be safely deleted.

#2: Janet rearranged some of the files on the host between the time we printed
out the listing and the time the original tape was made.  Several of the class
files were incorporated into a single file, with the previously
separately-compiled files being included in a single compilation unit.
However, there are no structural differences between the contents of the source
files in the two different versions.

#3: We can find no reference to a file called 'parser.incl.pl1' in any of our
files nor can anyone remember there ever being such a file.  Perhaps this is a
mistake?

#4: 'y.tab.incl.pl1' is simply a definition file generated by the Unix 'yacc'
utility from 'ghu.ply', after massaging by our Emacs macros.  See the Unix
documentation on 'yacc' for the description of the file 'y.tab.h'.

I look forward to seeing you on Thursday!
